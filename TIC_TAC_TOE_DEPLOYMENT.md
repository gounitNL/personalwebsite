## 🔍 Verify It's There (Before Merging)

You can verify the code is ready by checking the dev branch:

**View on GitHub:**
```
https://github.com/gounitNL/personalwebsite/blob/genspark_ai_developer/puzzle.html
```

Scroll to line 548-590 for the UI and line 1426+ for the JavaScript logic.

## 📊 Technical Details

### Tic Tac Toe Implementation:

**UI Location:** Lines 548-590 in puzzle.html
```html
<div class="game-menu-card" onclick="openGame('tictactoe')">
    <div class="icon">❌⭕</div>
    <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
    <p>Classic X's and O's game</p>
</div>
```

**Game Logic:** Lines 1426-1750+ in puzzle.html
- `initTicTacToe()` - Initialize/reset game
- `setTicTacToeMode()` - Switch between AI and 2-player
- `setTicTacToeDifficulty()` - Set AI difficulty
- `makePlayerMove()` - Handle player clicks
- `makeAIMove()` - AI decision making
- `getBestMove()` - Minimax algorithm for hard mode
- `checkTicTacToeWin()` - Win detection
- `updateTicTacToeScore()` - Score tracking

### AI Algorithm (Hard Mode):
The AI uses a **minimax decision tree** with the following strategy:
1. Check if AI can win (take winning move)
2. Check if player can win (block them)
3. Take center if available
4. Take corner if available
5. Take any remaining space

**Result:** Unbeatable AI on hard mode!
